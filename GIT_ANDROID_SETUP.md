# Git Configuration for Android App Development

## ✅ Successfully Configured Git Tracking

Your repository has been properly configured to track only the necessary Android development files while excluding build artifacts and sensitive information.

## 📁 Files Now Tracked in Git

### ✅ **Android Source Code & Configuration**
```
app/build.gradle                    # App module build configuration
app/src/                            # Complete Android source code
  ├── main/AndroidManifest.xml      # App manifest
  ├── main/java/                    # Java source files
  └── main/res/                     # Android resources (icons, layouts, etc.)

build.gradle                        # Root build configuration
settings.gradle                     # Gradle settings
gradle.properties                   # Gradle properties
twa-manifest.json                   # TWA configuration

gradle/wrapper/                     # Gradle wrapper (for consistent builds)
gradlew                            # Gradle wrapper script (Unix)
gradlew.bat                        # Gradle wrapper script (Windows)
```

### ✅ **Documentation**
```
ANDROID_APK_DISTRIBUTION.md        # Installation and distribution guide
.gitignore                         # Updated ignore rules
```

## 🚫 Files Properly Ignored

### 🔒 **Security-Sensitive Files (NEVER COMMIT)**
```
android.keystore                   # Signing keystore - contains private keys!
*.keystore                        # Any keystore files
*.jks                             # Java keystore files
```

### 🏗️ **Build Artifacts (Generated Files)**
```
*.apk                             # Built APK files
*.aab                             # Android App Bundle files
*.idsig                           # Signature files
app/build/                        # Build output directory
.gradle/                          # Gradle cache
build/                            # Any build directories
```

### 📄 **Generated/Temporary Files**
```
manifest-checksum.txt             # Generated checksum
store_icon.png                    # Generated icon
```

## 🔄 Git Workflow for Android Updates

### **For Future App Updates:**

1. **Make changes to your PWA** (the web app)
2. **Update Android configuration** if needed:
   ```bash
   # Edit twa-manifest.json for version bumps
   # Modify app/build.gradle for Android-specific changes
   ```
3. **Rebuild the APK**:
   ```bash
   bubblewrap build
   ```
4. **Commit only source changes**:
   ```bash
   git add twa-manifest.json app/build.gradle  # Only if changed
   git commit -m "feat: Update Android app to version X.X.X"
   ```

### **What NOT to Commit:**
- ❌ Never commit `*.apk` or `*.aab` files (they're large and change frequently)
- ❌ Never commit `android.keystore` (security risk!)
- ❌ Never commit `app/build/` or `.gradle/` (build artifacts)

## 🔐 Security Notes

### **Keystore Security:**
- Your `android.keystore` file contains private signing keys
- **Keep it secure and backed up separately**
- **Never commit it to version control**
- Store it in a secure location with the passwords

### **For Team Development:**
- Each developer should have their own keystore for development
- Use a shared keystore only for production releases
- Store production keystore securely (not in git)
