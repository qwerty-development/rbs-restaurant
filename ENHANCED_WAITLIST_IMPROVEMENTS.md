# Enhanced Waitlist Management System

## Overview
I've created an enhanced version of your waitlist page with significant improvements to the booking and notification workflow. Here's what I've built:

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Streamlined Action Flow**
- **Before**: Mark Notified → Create Booking → Mark Booked (multiple steps)
- **After**: Quick Book (one-click) OR Notify → Confirm Booking (two steps max)

### 2. **Smart Priority System**
- Automatic priority levels based on waiting time:
  - **High Priority**: 4+ hours (red alert with animation)
  - **Medium Priority**: 2-4 hours (yellow warning)
  - **Low Priority**: < 2 hours (green/normal)
- Visual indicators and dedicated priority tab

### 3. **Enhanced Booking Creation**
- **Quick Booking Dialog**: Real-time availability checking
- **Auto-table assignment**: Suggests best available tables
- **Context preservation**: Pre-fills all waitlist details
- **Conflict detection**: Shows occupied vs available tables
- **Smart workflow**: Auto-updates waitlist status when booking created

### 4. **Professional Notification System**
- **Multiple channels**: SMS, Email, Push notifications
- **Pre-built templates**: 
  - "Table is Ready" (immediate seating)
  - "Table Available Soon" (10-15 min warning)
